## Features
Aerial Combat adds many features and mechanics to set PVP/PVE airborne. 


<details>
<summary>Aerial Combat Mode</summary>

- The "Aerial Combat Mode" is toggleable (LEFT CONTROL by default) to keep the default Minecraft mechanics available when "Aerial Combat Mode" is unfavorable. Text will show above the hotbar, indicating whether it is on or off. (Aerial Combat: ON or Aerial Combat: OFF)

- While "Aerial Combat Mode" is enabled, the player will not take fall damage as it is very easy to die after a mid-air combo.

- While "Aerial Combat Mode" is enabled, the player has infinite air jumps (SPACE by default) to keep them in the air. This emits particles.

- "Aerial Combat Mode" is independent of "Auto Lock Mode" to allow players to use Aerial Combat without the limiting camera of Auto Lock. In turn, Auto Lock is fully compatible with default Minecraft combat.

<summary>Attacks</summary>

While "Aerial Combat Mode" is enabled, most attacks send the hit entity upwards.

### Upper Attack

- This attack, executed by sprint-hitting an entity, deals an extra 2 damage and sends the hit entity further upwards, a little out of reach.

- This can be used to end a combo or to get extra height if the player can hit the entity before it falls.

- Particles will be emitted when the attack is done correctly.

### Smash Attack

- This attack, executed by sneak-hitting an entity, deals an extra 2 damage and sends the hit entity down faster than falling.

- This is used to quickly end a combo as there usually isn't a way to continue hitting the entity post-attack. In return, the entity takes increased fall damage.

- Particles will be emitted when the attack is done correctly.

Double jumping is essential for aerial combos.
